My dad used to take me for village outreach and after I came to
US, he emboldened me to reach out to powerless Blacks and  poor 
Whites.I'd write about my real life research and he'd interpret how
to pray about those ,instead of losing hope or giving up on the powerless.

I went as a missionary to Belize in 2019 and prepped for it, by      
working along side Blacks and poor Whites in low salaried jobs,
for more than 4 years. WHen the work got tough,I used to remember
the crucifix my dad and I bought at a gold shop in 2010. That is the
only time my dad went to shop for gold with me..I still have that cross.

FROM MY ON-SITE RESEARCH , I found out that the logic of lobbyists
is far from real life. LObbyists say legalised abortion would make abortion
safe and rare. My research showed that : 
==>Abortion increased and Blacks are being replaced by lighter-skinned
  illegal immigrants in US jobs.
This little girl, Jakelin Caal died of a viral fever after an unhygeinic illegal immigrant caravan
journey , into USA, on 8 December, 2018.Caravan viral fever killed a precious illegal immigrant child in 2018,
and covid viral fever is killing millions in 2020.COVID closed US borders for illegal immigration,even 
though the Republicans could not do so,in spite of gaining the control of the senate, house and White 
house in 2017.I guess the  GOVERNMENT IS ON GOD'S SHOULDERS. SO please do not worry
too much about US Elections on NOv 3rd, 2020.


==>  Most of the Blacks in low salaried jobs had been protesting and
had  failed to graduate and are  stuck in jobs , that treat them like
"  they don't matter ".I Mean, they don't even have a  desk or work 
 bench at their workplace - they are  just a "NUMBER" on the 
assembly line6     or assembly line 7 and are walked to that assigned 
place like prisoners , by the Black CEO .It was surreal. like going back
decades to the era of the movie,GONE WITH THE WIND ,where prisoners
are walked to work !! 

 Illegal immigrants could easily take their place.So Black  babies
in US  are aborted,AS IF THEY DON'T MATTER,in order to make room for 
fairer -skinned illegal immigrants in US.  I think,that is why, naive Blacks       
are drawn easily into BLM ,cause they hope it would make their lives matter.
But first BLM has made, Blacks life NOT MATTER, so that, it can gain 
wahtever it is BLM wants to gain - illegal immigrants, aborted baby organs,
more taxes for welfare money that can be mishandled ....

I actually walked alongside of these precious low salaried Blacks and 
poor Whites, and asked so many questions and got more than I bargained for
     - HEART ACHE at the HEARTLESS  way, our Blacks and poor Whites are 
        deceived and diverted by protests.


Blacks in US Low salaried jobs,are not even trained to show up for work regularly
 after the protests- due to 
TOLERANCE,CRIMINAL JUSTICE OF LESSENING PUNISHMENT,
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS etc.. -  Poor Whites atleast have to 
be responsible to pay for child support as most of the Whites in the low 
salaried jobs ,that I had done my research in,  have elders, who have a 
good head on their shoulders.THese elderly Whites had put their foot down,
 to stop many poor White men from aborting their babies !! So poor White
men whine for 9 months, then watch their baby and forget their rootless life 
and are atleast rooted to the extent of showing up to enjoy the custody of their
 baby.Sometimes the baby makes them so proud that they marry the baby's 
mom and change their life around. I have personally interviewed such moms !!
They are so glad that they didn't abort the baby,when the boy friend said
he'd dump her if she didn't abort the baby !! 

Instead of aborting babies, I pray the, US doctors,to take a second job two days
or nights on a weekend to work alongside the low salaried, minimum wage
workers, and help make BLACK LIVES ACTUALLY MATTER - not just
helping Blacks wear a BLM T-shirt..IN order to make BLack lives matter,
we need to put some sense IN the brains of Blacks - not just a BLM T-shirt 
on the Black backs !! The fact of the matter is, that, poor Whites are next
in line to join the group ,whose lives do not matter. Just as US Blacks are
turned into  addicts,so that illegal immigrants could take their jobs, poor WHites
are being turned into addicts, so legal ,well-educated immigrants, like myself
could take thier jobs - because ,our Indian caste kings would rather enslave
White people rather than develop Indian economy ot stop brain drain to US.
If the elderly WHIte people didn't have remnat of US courage and cool thinking,
the younger US WHItes,who are already eating out of the hnds of ASian women,
would have long bankrupted US economy.As is, they have incurred trillions of
dollars of debt - out of which 1.6 trillion is owed to ....CHINA !! 


Not just the White elders, even White CEOs take up the task of disciplining 
the Blacks and poor Whites , who work in low salaried jobs in their company . 
   Blacks leave and join BLM protests, while poor Whites tough it out and
after 4 or 6 or 10 years of whining at work, finally settle down and put down
stable roots of sanity and push themselves towards positive progress.

Sometimes, I think, Americans are like children - being given candy,so they'd
be quiet while the parents irresponsibly enjoy alcohol in the other room !!
Welfare programs and food stamps are like candy, so that powerful Blacks and 
Hispanic drug lords  can keep enjoying profits while the Black women and kids,
who are dependants of drug addicts are quietened by welfare programs.

Black men are not being trained to respect women or be responsible towards
 the care of women and children. Atleast the poor Whites,whom, I had interviewed
 had to 'tough it out' ,since,they  wouldn't get grandma's house when she dies, if 
they aborts a baby.In that process  to please the grandma, the poor White men 
get clean, after a decade or two !! Some even showed the photos of their kids,
and were proud of their kids !!


Our White CEO ,a milionaire, who gave up his money to create jobs for the poor,
 actually stands alongside poor Whites and Blacks and trains them to be clean,
 responsible, and does not allow them to indulge in drugs, idle chats,cell phones etc....
 I pray,that, taxes are not increased on such middle class millionaire small businessmen.

  Black CEOs are not interested in disciplining our Blacks and are not 
pressuring powerless Blacks to push towards positive progres,and are not
training Blacks to make Black lives Matter in real life (not on media show biz )


   So our Blacks  come to work ,  when they  need money and abscond to spend 
it while protesting with shouts, dances,burning flags.Powerful Black CEOs do not take 
the trouble to train poor Black men, to respect women and be responsible towards
 Black kids.While studying election law at Washington university, in 2016, I had 
interviewed many Blacks, in low salaried jobs, (for a real life  research).Sadly, I 
found out, that they are trained to  Date, Abort,  Dump the baby's dad. Tragically,
that's what DAD means to powerless Blacks in 2020                 
                              DAD=Date,
                                         Abort his baby,
                                         Dump the dad
The men just  repeat the whole process with consecutive naive girls (sometimes 
they cheat even in that "really small duration" of a relationship) Being faithful and 
consistent are STRANGE things, to these naive Blacks, who slave to make profits
for powerful  Black millionaires & company owners and even billionaire celebrities.
At a BOEING building, in a meeting where state elected officials were present, an
elderly Black gentlemen had the audacity to blatantly blurt out,"Since the nuclear
family is becoming non-existent, ..." Just like that !!!



If I put a  Black girl  in front of a camera or microphone, she might recite the agenda
of woman's choice of abortion etc....But since I was not a media person, but merely
another Black mom, at work, standing alongside, her, many a Black girl told me,that,
she had actually thought that ,if she aborted her boyfriend's baby and saved money,
he'd marry her and they could make their lives matter . But after the baby was aborted
 she had found out, that, the boy friend was cheating on her, all the while and so she
 dumped the dad of the baby she had aborted. 

 One 19 yr old, Black girl, found out that , while her baby's dad was telling her to abort 
her baby, he had fathered another baby with another woman ! Some had shown me photos
of their baby showers - only to abort the wee little one, cause the IRRESPONSIBLE
Black boy friend had changed his mind and threatened to leave !!


Unless abortion ends and our Blacks are trained to be responsible towards our women,
babies & kids, BLM stands for  Blatantly Lying Male chauvinists, atleast in my view !!

Racism exists, when the powerful Blacks expect powerless Blacks to be limited to  lower 
standards, almost stooping to the standards  of  animal kindom, while expecting Whites to
 reach higher standards of social responsibility of protecting spouse and kids.


Just as the  White heroine of the movie,"GONE WITH THE WIND", used poor White
prisoners,instead of free employees, in 2020, powerful Black Americans are using immigrants
(legal & illegal),  instead of Blacks as employees.That's how slavery started in USA ,in the 
first place . IT was powerful (poor&rich) Blacks in AFrica, who sold powerless Blacks
as slaves to Hispanics, who git US Whites addicted to using slaves.We still have slaves in
India and Africa,and of course in Wuhan ,China...but White people , who were majority
CHristian at that time(1800s) set their slaves free, by going to the extent of killing their
own White slave owners.Even in 1949, it was the Whites who destroued White supremacist,
Hitler. Harris,the honorable, senator, the daughter of a highest castist should be freeing lower 
caste slaves in US.But in 2020, in Philadelphia, Atlanta,Saint Louis, caste supremacy 
discrimination has been firmly planted ,by allowing ONLYhighest caste Brahmins, like Sen.Harris's
grandfather, whom she declared has influenced her.No wonder, the minute former VP BIden
chose her as running mate, higher caste men started wrecking havoc in Hathras, India !!


 In order to make it seem logical. powerful Americans say, immigrants only take the jobs,that
Americans are not willing to do. Why are Americans not willing to do some jobs ? Because they
are still honest and refuse to use fake resumes like caste corruption people do.Americans refuse to
take the jobs they are not trained to do.So Google asks for increase in immigrant visas, instead
of training honest  Americans for the jobs. They bring monogamous, caste ladies as immigrants ,
and bully / batter them to use fake resume and get IT jobs in US ,while keeping poor Blacks as 
cheap baby organ providers or cheap labor that need not be  trained to have a healthy standard 
of work ethic -
               a group that DOES NOT MATTER as a human being. And on top of that, they want
 us to pay to watch Black celebrities - luring our Powerless Black teens to submit to lower 
standards in most areas of life - dreaming,dating,dancing,daring,enduring,endeavoring...
And the tax payers are support that agenda and congratulate the dancing representative AOC
as a great philanthropist, just because ,she wears the photo of a little 8yr old Guatemalan girl,
 killed due to illegal immigration , just as a deer hunter hangs his prey on his walls as a TROPHY !!

                    <h2>COVID19 viral fever-2019</h2>


This little girl, Jakelin Caal died of a viral fever after an unhygeinic illegal immigrant caravan
journey , into USA, on 8 December, 2018.Caravan viral fever killed a precious illegal immigrant child in 2018,
and covid viral fever is killing millions in 2020.COVID closed US borders for illegal immigration,even 
though the Republicans could not do so,in spite of gaining the control of the senate, house and White 
house in 2017.I guess the  GOVERNMENT IS ON GOD'S SHOULDERS. SO please do not worry
too much about US Elections on NOv 3rd, 2020.

It is agood thing that, the White people had freed the slaves, but that means they have to start
doing the work without slaves. US Cannot afford to have lame duck sessions anymore -
this is a serious war against  COVID19, brought into  US by  immigrants/ tourists !!


I've read about few Whites who let the protests get to their head and get
violent, but have never had a chance to interview them.

Irresponsible Whites are strictly fired and trespassed from work by White CEOs.
 I had seen that with my own eyes. When the CEO warned the  irresponsible Black, the
 Black person actually threatened to sue the CEO !! 
I was so dumb founded !!
Here was this White millionaire CEO, stooping down to pull low salaried
Blacks and WHites up to a responsible status the MATTERS, and he gets
empty, legal threats from Black person,while the Whites are shaken into doing
a better job. I told my boss Iam not working there, if the big Black person continues
to shout and protest against him (the boss). The boss is slim and could have
been easily choked or hurt by the Black person. It is about time, to stop patronizing
our Blacks and start telling Blacks that thier entitlement attitude needs to be shed.

I still am scared of this Black person,wo had protested loudly against our CEO, but
 our FIRM STANCE made her stop her loud protests, empty legal threats.Now she 
is working honestly.No more sliding back into being irresponsible at work.

But sadly, not many dark-skinned moms stand up,in order to strictly train Black girls 
at work. Every day ,I see her walk to catch a bus home and praise God for
using me to take a courageous stance to DISCIPLE this precious Black 
young girl.She had been taught to protest ,when told to work harder and
drop out of work/school and run around BLM lawyers to bring empty legal
law suits on those who tried to make her LIFE MATTER !!

But as a Black mom, I told that I'd not stand by as she threatened and put the slim
White CEO in physical danger.She was bigger than he was .That did it.She backed
off and is now working so well - it is a thing of beauty - a joy for ever !
If Father Hyer had not started ACCollege, my kids would have been just as poor as
that precious ,poor Black girl ! ANd I'd definitely wished for someone to stand up and
strictly train her to work hard and MAKE HER LIFE MATTER !!

The well-meaning, people in US democratic party, who sit in the senate have no clue what
 the lobbyists hide from them, in order to increase taxes and get more welfare
 money to give out to young Black girls ,just so the poor Black girls could be patronized
by them to be trained to be dated, and dumped by many male chavunists, who get rid
 of the responsibility  towards women and  baby, by telling women to abort their precious baby !!

Who'd want to watch this blatant lie that enables many a Black man to abuse  Black girls,
abort Black babies and waste their lives on drugs,dances,protests and putrid agendas !!
No wonder Mrs Michelle Obama said,"We didn't do anything, and the Whites moved out
of our neighborhood". Powerful Blacks need to do something - some strict, discipling
of Black boys and Black men, instead of using them as pawns to raise taxes to get more 
welfare monay to mismanage. 

Our Indians outright told us," that is a Black majority area .Don't buy a house there"
Indians tend to buy houses close to each other. But we bought a house close
to the church school in a White majority area. I had to travel nearly 30 miles to
daily to work on my research with our Blacks and poor Whites.(Actually I had to cross
the state lines and go to another state.)

Tax payer funds were used to help Planned parenthood abort
babies and sell baby organs as line items (as if they are medicine bottles, labelled on an
assembly line, to be sold for profit -or to be given to research, to help some affluenza American
to live longer after she drank herself into being a cancer patient or used Marijuana to the extent
of damaging her organs).

Since our state has legalized marijuana in 2019, I think, that cancer of
casual DAD(date ,abort ,dump the irresponsible dad) might be showing up in our
state also. I DON'T LOSE HOPE - becasue my dad never gave up hope on me,
even when I nearly died of teen suicide. 

Inspite of deaths due to caraan viral fever or covid19 viral fever,
I KNOW EVERY BLACK HAS HOPE ,WHEN GODLY MEN LIKE YOURSELF 
               STAND IN THE GAP - and drive some common sense into their
               heads struck senseless by Hollywood agenda of 
              DAD ( Date,Abort ,Dump) &
              DIP (Drug use/dealing,  Idolising celebrities, Protest that help gain temporary celebrity status)
